# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude (and humans) working in this repo.

## What this is

ChongKit is a set of TTRPG tools for one table running **Nimble 5e (v2)**, plus **Chong's Tracker**, a
system-agnostic Owlbear Rodeo extension (see its own section below; the Nimble ground rules don't
apply to it). The rules source is
`source/nimble-gm-guide-v2.0.1.pdf` (Nimble 5e v2 GM Guide v2.0.1, 115 pages).
Page numbers in code and docs are the **printed** page numbers (PDF page index = printed + 1).

## Ground rules (Nimble tools: the combat generator, rules reference)

1. **The guide is the source of truth.** Every number (HP, damage, DCs, gold, difficulty bands) must
   come from the PDF and cite its page in a comment. If a value is derived (not printed in the guide),
   say so explicitly in code comments, the README, and the UI.
2. **Dice are randomized but average-preserving.** Any damage shown must average *exactly* the
   guide's damage-per-round (only level-1/4's 3 dmg may be ±0.5 — no exact dice exist). Never change
   this without updating `tests/generator.test.js`.
3. **Keep tools zero-install.** Plain HTML + vanilla JS that opens from `file://`. No build step, no
   frameworks, no CDN scripts. The only external request allowed is Google Fonts, and every page
   must still work offline on its fallback fonts.
4. **Match the GM Guide's look.** Parchment background, thin brown corner flourishes, heavy
   wedge-serif headings (Merriweather 900 standing in for Beaufort Pro Heavy), condensed sans body
   (Barlow Semi Condensed for Avenir Next Condensed), notched-corner stat blocks with italic
   small-caps names, grey arrow-tipped ability bars, heart/shield icons for HP/armor, dark red
   (`--blood`) for Bloodied numbers. Reuse the classes and tokens in `assets/css/nimble.css`.
5. **Keep it simple.** This is for use mid-session at the table; favor big readable numbers over features.
   - No helper or explainer text in the UI (no "tap here to…" tips, no difficulty descriptions, no
     "how this is worked out"). Labels and numbers only; explanations belong in the README.
   - No dice rolling or HP tracking. The tool shows stats; the table rolls real dice.
   - Controls must look clickable: squared, bordered buttons and toggles (`.btn`, `.seg`, `.stepper`).
     Arrow-tipped ribbons (`.bar`) are for ability text only, never for buttons.
6. **Always pull, then commit and push straight to `main`.** Pull (`git pull --rebase origin main`) before
   starting work and before pushing; work happens on several devices. Don't create branches or pull requests.
7. **The repo is a GitHub Pages site** (served from `main`, root folder). Keep it organized:
   - Each tool lives in its own folder with an `index.html` (so its URL is `/<tool-name>/`).
   - Add every new tool as a card on the root `index.html`.
   - Shared styles go in `assets/css/nimble.css`. Link it with a relative path (`../assets/css/nimble.css`).
   - Use relative links only. Never start a link with `/`: the site is served under `/<repo-name>/`.
   - Anything that must not be public (the PDF, tests, notes) goes in `_config.yml` → `exclude`.
   - Keep the Nimble 3rd Party Creator License attribution in every page footer.

## Chong's Tracker (Owlbear Rodeo extension)

A separate tool with its own rules. It is **system-agnostic**: no Nimble rules, no GM Guide numbers.

1. **Owlbear's look**, not the GM Guide's: colors come from `OBR.theme`, Roboto/system fonts, no
   parchment. Don't use `assets/css/nimble.css` there.
2. **It tracks HP on purpose.** The "no HP tracking" rule above is for the combat generator only.
   Still no dice: HP boxes do arithmetic (`20-3`), the table rolls real dice.
3. **State lives in the scene's metadata only** (never room metadata): one key per entry
   (`com.chongkit.tracker/e/<id>`, deleted = `null`) plus `com.chongkit.tracker/tabs`. Token badges
   are local items drawn by `background.js`, never saved.
4. **The Owlbear SDK is the one install exception**: `vendor/obr-sdk.js` is `@owlbear-rodeo/sdk`
   bundled once with esbuild into a single ESM file and committed. Everything else stays plain
   HTML + vanilla JS with no build step. To update the SDK, rebuild that one file (see README).
5. **Manifest paths are absolute** (`/ChongKit/chongs-tracker/...`): the site is served under
   `/ChongKit/`. This is the only place a path starts with `/`.
6. Keep the logic that can be tested (math, HP rules, parsing, metadata) in `core.js`, which works as
   a browser script (`window.ChongCore`) and a CommonJS module, and cover it in `tests/core.test.js`.
7. Its status and backlog live in `chongs-tracker/TRACKER.md`.

README.md                    What the tools are and how to use them

```

`nimble-data.js` and `generator.js` work both as browser scripts (globals `NIMBLE`, `Gen`) and as
CommonJS modules for Node tests.

## Commands

- Test: `node --test combat-generator/tests/*.test.js chongs-tracker/tests/*.test.js` (Node 18+, no dependencies)
- Run: `python3 -m http.server` in the repo root, then open http://localhost:8000/ (this matches how GitHub Pages serves it). Opening a tool's `index.html` directly also works.

## Reading the PDF

Text extraction works with PyMuPDF: `pip install pymupdf`, then
`python3 -c "import pymupdf; d=pymupdf.open('source/nimble-gm-guide-v2.0.1.pdf'); print(d[30].get_text())"` — the 0-based
index equals the printed page number, so `d[30]` is printed p.30 (Monster Builder).
Bestiary stat blocks (p.33–41) extract with HP numbers detached from their monsters — verify
against a rendered page image before transcribing.

## Workflow

- **Always pull first.** Run `git pull --rebase origin main` at the start of every session and again before
  committing: work happens on several devices, so the local copy may be behind.
- Update `TRACKER.md` (or `chongs-tracker/TRACKER.md` for the tracker) when a task starts/finishes.
- Run the tests before committing, then push to `main`.
