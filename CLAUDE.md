# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude (and humans) working in this repo.

## What this is

ChongKit is a set of TTRPG tools for one table running **Nimble 5e (v2)**. The rules source is
`source/nimble-gm-guide-v2.0.1.pdf` (Nimble 5e v2 GM Guide v2.0.1, 115 pages).
Page numbers in code and docs are the **printed** page numbers (PDF page index = printed + 1).

## Ground rules

1. **The guide is the source of truth.** Every number (HP, damage, DCs, gold, difficulty bands) must
   come from the PDF and cite its page in a comment. If a value is derived (not printed in the guide),
   say so explicitly in code comments, the README, and the UI.
2. **Dice are randomized but average-preserving.** Any damage shown must average *exactly* the
   guide's damage-per-round (only level-1/4's 3 dmg may be ±0.5 — no exact dice exist). Never change
   this without updating `tests/generator.test.js`.
3. **Keep tools zero-install.** Plain HTML + vanilla JS that opens from `file://`. No build step, no
   frameworks, no CDN scripts. The only external request allowed is Google Fonts, and every page
   must still work offline on its fallback fonts.
4. **Match the GM Guide's look.** Parchment background, thin brown corner flourishes, heavy
   wedge-serif headings (Merriweather 900 standing in for Beaufort Pro Heavy), condensed sans body
   (Barlow Semi Condensed for Avenir Next Condensed), notched-corner stat blocks with italic
   small-caps names, grey arrow-tipped ability bars, heart/shield icons for HP/armor, dark red
   (`--blood`) for Bloodied numbers. Reuse the classes and tokens in `assets/css/nimble.css`.
5. **Keep it simple.** This is for use mid-session at the table; favor big readable numbers over features.
6. **Always commit and push straight to `main`.** Don't create branches or pull requests.
7. **The repo is a GitHub Pages site** (served from `main`, root folder). Keep it organized:
   - Each tool lives in its own folder with an `index.html` (so its URL is `/<tool-name>/`).
   - Add every new tool as a card on the root `index.html`.
   - Shared styles go in `assets/css/nimble.css`. Link it with a relative path (`../assets/css/nimble.css`).
   - Use relative links only. Never start a link with `/`: the site is served under `/<repo-name>/`.
   - Anything that must not be public (the PDF, tests, notes) goes in `_config.yml` → `exclude`.
   - Keep the Nimble 3rd Party Creator License attribution in every page footer.

## Layout

```
index.html                   Site landing page: a card for each tool   → /
_config.yml                  GitHub Pages config (excludes repo-only files)
assets/css/nimble.css        Shared GM-Guide look for every page
combat-generator/            → /combat-generator/
  index.html                 UI
  nimble-data.js             All rules data from the guide (single source of numbers)
  generator.js               Pure logic: dice, encounter building, rewards, attack rolls
  tests/generator.test.js    node:test suite (not published)
docs/rules-reference.md      Rules tables with page numbers → /docs/rules-reference.html
source/                      The GM Guide PDF (not published)
README.md                    What the tools are and how to use them
TRACKER.md                   Status and backlog (not published)
CLAUDE.md                    This file (not published)
```

`nimble-data.js` and `generator.js` work both as browser scripts (globals `NIMBLE`, `Gen`) and as
CommonJS modules for Node tests.

## Commands

- Test: `node --test combat-generator/tests/*.test.js` (Node 18+, no dependencies)
- Run: `python3 -m http.server` in the repo root, then open http://localhost:8000/ (this matches how GitHub Pages serves it). Opening a tool's `index.html` directly also works.

## Reading the PDF

Text extraction works with PyMuPDF: `pip install pymupdf`, then
`python3 -c "import pymupdf; d=pymupdf.open('source/nimble-gm-guide-v2.0.1.pdf'); print(d[30].get_text())"` — the 0-based
index equals the printed page number, so `d[30]` is printed p.30 (Monster Builder).
Bestiary stat blocks (p.33–41) extract with HP numbers detached from their monsters — verify
against a rendered page image before transcribing.

## Workflow

- Update `TRACKER.md` when a task starts/finishes.
- Run the tests before committing, then push to `main`.
